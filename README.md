# work-sample

Hey there !,
my name is Rohit, and I am software engineer.

ths repository is only for work sample purpose. this repository contains one microservice project which is only created for showcasing how to use different dependencies of maven to create a microservice project. There no business logic behind the code, API's are written only to demonstrate how it can be written. Further i will keep adding multiple things that are used in microservice.

Till now these are the implemented technologies in this project: 
1. Spring cloud Eureka client
2. Spring cloud Eureka server
3. Spring cloud Gateway 
4. spring validation
5. Distributed tracing system
    - zipkin
    - micrometer
6. Swagger API documentation
